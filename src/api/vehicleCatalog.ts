/**
 * src/api/vehicleCatalog.ts
 *
 * Vehicle make/model lookups (manufacturers -> models), used by
 * SuperAdminPage's vehicle-master-data tooling. Backed by the shared
 * backend's vehicle_manufacturers / vehicle_models tables — same tables
 * the customer-facing marketplace app uses for its own vehicle selector,
 * hence the `/api/marketplace/...` URL path below (backend route naming,
 * unrelated to this app's own file/folder names).
 *
 * This file used to be api/marketplace.ts, a much larger client for the
 * whole customer marketplace (search, cart, orders, order tracking).
 * None of that applies to this app — it was trimmed down to just the
 * two functions actually used here when this app was split off from
 * red-piston-frontend (see AGENT_NOTES.md at the repo root).
